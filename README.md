# Notion API testing

Just a collection of experiments with the Notion API, in an attempt to streamline my own workflows, but more a time sink when I should be doing other things :D.

### Notion to GCal
- Sync script to pull events from a Notion database and push them to a Google Calendar.
- Ideally will be running on my Pi with a cron job.

### Notion To-Dos to Apple Reminders
- Sync script to pull to-dos from a Notion database and push them to Apple Reminders.
- Honestly just too complicated, and I don't have an macOS server to run it on.
